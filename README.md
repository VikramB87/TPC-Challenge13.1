*Array Slice*

A 'slice' of an array is subset of consecutive values of the array. (no wraparound). A 2-slice of an array is defined as a slice of the array which contains at most 2 different values.
Write a program to find the size of the largest 2-slice of a given array.

For example, for the input array: [1,2,2,1,3,3,1,3] the largest 2-slice has size 5, which is {1,3,3,1,3}.

Inputs: The first input line has the number of test cases. Each test case has the number of elements in the array (N), followed by array elements (Xn)
Output: The size of largest 2-slice of the array.

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 1,000,000
0 <= Xn <= 4,294,967,296
